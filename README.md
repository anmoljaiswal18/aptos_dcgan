EYE Disease Classification on Diabetic Retinopathy.

◦ Designed a well-structured deep learning classification model for Diabetic Retinopathy eye disease on APTOS Dataset.
◦ Strategically implemented the DCGAN Model along with Attention Layers to solve issues of imbalanced dataset,
augmentation, extraction and preserving significant features.
◦ Achieved 89.46 % testing accuracy(good in comparison with state of the art approaches) from DenseNet121 Model.
